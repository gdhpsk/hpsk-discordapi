# hpsk-discordapi
My own custom API wrapper for the discord API! if you want more documentation on this, feel free to contact me on discord or email (gdhpsk@gmail.com). The first couple versions of this package are supposed to be just minor fixes, so please use versions 1.2.1 or above. I will try to keep this package actively maintained, and updated asap.
